# Breaktimer Microphone Daemon

[BreakTimer](https://github.com/tom-james-watson/breaktimer-app) is a useful tool for prompting you to take break while working and preventing RSI/Eyestrain. However, it can trigger these breaks during meetings, causing annoyance while screensharing.

This daemon solves this issue by watching the status of the default microphone. If it is in use, even if you are on mute, breaks will be disabled.

## Limitations

Currently this program works exclusively on MacOS.
